# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs. This project was the product of a code-along at Red Academy. An additional challenge was placed was given to be creative with Javascript and create additional features. I chose to adjust the goal method so that the game would end if either of the players scored a total score of 10. 

## Setup

* To begin Pong game, click anywhere on the pong board! 
* Each player can score upto 10 points at which point an alert box will pop up in the browser with the exclamation "Yahoo!". When either player has scored a total of ten points, the game will reset !
* Each time a player scores, the ball will reset in the middle of the pong board.


**Install dependencies:**

`> npm i`

**Run locally with Webpack Dev Server:**

`> npm start`

**Build for production:**

`> npm run build`

## Keys
  The space bar will pause the game.
**Player 1:**
* a: up
* z: down

**Player 2:**
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down
